# Cryptocurrencies

This challenge shows how we can use unsupervised learning to process data, cluster, reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. I used these skills to analyze the cryptocurrency market. I will look at what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment for our client, Accountability Accounting. 
The data we have is not ideal so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies we will use a clustering algorithm and then data visualizations to share her findings with Accountability Accounting. 

### Four Technical Analysis Deliverables:
1) Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2) Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3) Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4) Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


Below is a table created to show tradable cryptocurrencies.

Below is a 3D scatter plot of the clusters we created.
